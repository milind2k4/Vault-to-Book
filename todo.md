in the callout blocks,
if the block is like

> [!TIP] > **Analogy**
> - **WHERE:** The bouncer at the club entrance checking IDs (filters individuals).
> - **GROUP BY:** Organizing people into tables based on their shirt color.
> - **HAVING:** The waiter checking which tables have more than 5 people (filters groups).

then the filter treats the whole block as title.
