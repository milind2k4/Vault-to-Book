# Linear Collections
### List
It is an interface for an **ordered** collection of elements.

Features of this interface:

- Allows duplicate elements
- Maintains insertion order
- Supports NULL values
- Index-based access
- Non-synchronized (for modern implementations)

List is implemented by: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and `Vector`.

#### Common List Methods

- `add(Object o)`: Appends to the end.
- `add(int index, Object o)`: Inserts at a specific index.
- `get(int index)`: Returns element at the index.
- `set(int index, Object o)`: Updates an element.
- `remove(Object o)`: Removes the first occurrence of the object.
- `remove(int index)`: Removes the element at the index.
- `indexOf(Object o)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence.
- `lastIndexOf(Object o)`
- `contains(Object o) -> bool`: Checks if an element is present or not.
- `size()`
- `clear()`: Remove all the elements from the list.

#### ArrayList (implements List)

It is a class that implements a **resizable array**.

- It has the same features as `List`.
- Fast for random access (`get()`).
- Slower for insertions/deletions in the middle.
- It by default has size 10 and it grows by 1.5x when full.

### LinkedList
Java's LinkedList is a doubly-linked list.

It also implements the Deque (Double-Ended Queue) interface.

- It can store duplicate as well as null values.
- It follows insertion order.
- It is non-synchronized.
- Fast for insertions/deletions (at the beginning, middle, or end).
- Slow for random access (`get()`), as it must traverse the list.

Because it implements `Deque`, it has methods for adding/removing from both ends:

```java
addFirst(object o);
addLast(object o);
getFirst();
getLast();
removeFirst();
removeLast();
```

### Vector
It is a legacy class (JDK 1.0) that acts like a resizable array.

- It is **synchronized** (thread-safe).
- It by default has size 10 and it grows by **2x** when full.
- `ArrayList` is preferred in single-threaded environments.

### Stack

It is a legacy class (JDK 1.0) that extends `Vector`.

- Implements LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) order.
- It is **synchronized**.
- The modern, preferred alternative is using an `ArrayDeque`.

#### Methods

```java
push(object o);
pop();
peek();
search(object o); // returns 1-based index, or -1
empty(); // checks if stack is empty
```

### Queue
An interface for a collection that follows **FIFO** (First-In, First-Out) order.

Classes used to implement queue:

- `LinkedList` (a general-purpose queue)
- `PriorityQueue` (a priority-based queue)
- `ArrayDeque` (a double-ended queue)

#### PriorityQueue

It implements the `Queue` interface, but orders elements by priority.

- By default, it is a **min-heap** (the smallest element has the highest priority and is at the head).
- We can provide a `Comparator` for custom ordering.
- It is non-synchronized.
- Does not follow insertion order.

Methods come in two flavors:

1. **Throws Exception:** `add()`, `remove()` (removes head), `element()` (peeks head)
2. **Returns Special Value:** `offer()` (returns `false` if full), `poll()` (returns `null` if empty), `peek()` (returns `null` if empty)
