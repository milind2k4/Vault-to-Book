# Joins

Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

We need to join tables when we do not have the desired data in one table.

| Join Type      | Description                                                                  | Venn Diagram Analogy      |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns records that have matching values in **both** tables.                | Intersection ($A \cap B$) |
| **LEFT JOIN**  | Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right. | $A$ (entire circle)       |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left. | $B$ (entire circle)       |
| **FULL JOIN**  | Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.     | Union ($A \cup B$)        |

```sql
SELECT S.Name, C.CourseName
FROM Student S
INNER JOIN Enrollments E ON S.ID = E.StudentID
INNER JOIN Courses C ON E.CourseID = C.ID;
```

#### Inner Join

Fetches common tuples (rows that have matching values in both tables).

```sql
SELECT supplier.supplier_id, supplier.supplier_name, orders.order_date 
FROM supplier INNER JOIN orders
ON supplier.supplier_id = orders.supplier_id;
```

#### Outer Join

Fetches all tuples from one table and the common ones from the other.

- **Left Outer Join:** All tuples from A (the "left" table) and the common ones from B.
- **Right Outer Join:** All tuples from B (the "right" table) and the common ones from A.
- **Full Outer Join:** All tuples from both tables.

```sql
SELECT supplier.supplier_id, supplier.supplier_name, orders.order_date 
FROM supplier RIGHT JOIN orders
ON supplier.supplier_id = orders.supplier_id;
```

```sql
SELECT supplier.supplier_id, supplier.supplier_name, orders.order_date 
FROM supplier FULL JOIN orders
ON supplier.supplier_id = orders.supplier_id;
```

#### Equi Join

This is a join that only uses an equality operator (=) in its condition.

The "Inner Join" example above is an Equi Join. The older ANSI-89 syntax also performs an Equi Join:

```sql
SELECT columns 
FROM table1, table2, table3 .... 
WHERE table1.column_name = table2.column_name; 
```

It is better practice to use the `INNER JOIN...ON` syntax to separate the join logic from the `WHERE` clause filtering logic.

#### Self Join

When one table is joined with itself. We _must_ use table aliases (like `a` and `b`) to distinguish the two instances of the table.

```sql
-- Find employees who earn less than other employees
SELECT a.name, a.salary, b.name, b.salary
FROM Customers a, Customers b
WHERE a.salary < b.salary;
```
