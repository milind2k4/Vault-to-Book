Part of physics which deals with study of charge. 

### Charge
Property of object due to which it can create electric and magnetic effects around it. 

It is property of an object due to which it can experience electric and magnetic effects. 

Its unit is Coulomb (C). The CGS unit is esu (electrostatic unit). $1\ C = 3 \times 10^{9}\ esu$. 
It has dimensions $\ce{ [IT] }$.

#### Properties of Charge 
It is a scalar quantity and is of two types, +ve and -ve.
-ve charge means excess of e. 
+ve charge means deficiency of e.

**Charge on electron:** $e^{-} = -1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C
**Charge on proton:** $p^{+} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C

Charge is quantised and not continuous. I.e., it can only exist as integral multiples of fundamental charge, $e^{-}$. 
$$Q = ne$$

Like point charges repel and unlike attract. These forces are called *electrostatic forces.*

Charge is conserved. Net charge cannot be created or destroyed.

If a charge is at rest, it can create electric effects around itself and can experience electric forces. It cannot create or experience magnetic forces. 

If a charge is moving with constant velocity, then it will create and experience electric and magnetic effects. 

If a charge is moving with variable velocity, then it will emit electromagnetic waves (radiations). 

Charge is relativistically invariant, i.e. value of charge doesn't depend on its velocity.

### Materials 
##### Conductor
Which transfer electricity/energy with less resistance.
Free e are responsible for the transfer.

Charge on conductor stays on surface.

![](images/Pasted image 20231018192700.png)

##### Non-conductors 
aka **Insulators or Dielectric.**
[[14 Dielectrics]]

They do not have free e as to remove the outermost e a lot of E is required. 

They are bad conductors of energy and electricity. It creates a very high resistance. 

The charge in conductor stays in its volume.

### Charging
##### Thermionic Effect
The KE of e is directly proportional to temp..

As we increase temp. KE increases the e get removed and the metal gets +vely charged. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231018193516.png)

##### Photoelectric Effect
A high E photon transfers its E to the outer e of the metal and removed it thus +vely charging it.

![](images/Pasted image 20231018193711.png)

##### Field Emission
We bring a highly +vely charged object near the metal which attracts the -vely charged e and thus charge the metal +vely. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231018193906.png)

##### Friction
Rubbing two materials together transfers e to the material which has more [[03 Electron Affinity|e affinity.]] 

It will charge both of the materials. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231018194101.png)

##### Conduction 
If we connect two conductors one of which has charge, the charge gets evenly distributed and the neutral also gets charged. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231018194503.png)

##### Induction 
Due to presence of charges near a conductor, charge on conductor may redistribute itself. This phenomenon is known as induction.

![](images/Pasted image 20231018194904.png)

To charge using induction,

![](images/Pasted image 20231018195305.png)

## Solid Angle
We know that angle is defined as,
$$\theta = \frac{ \text{Arc} }{ R }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231212160157.png)

Similarly, in 3D, solid angle is defined as,
$$\ohm = \frac{ \text{Area} }{ R^{2} }$$
where area is the section of spherical surface which is intersected by the cone whose apex solid angle is $\Omega$.

Solid angle has unit **steradian.** 

![](images/Pasted image 20231212160254.png)

For complete sphere,
$$\ohm = \frac{ 4\pi R^{2} }{ R^{2} } = 4\pi \ \text{steradian}$$

Like complete circle, for which angle is $2\pi$.

**Flux per unit solid angle/steradian,**
$$\frac{ \phi }{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_{o} } = kQ$$
It has unit $\ce{ N m^{2} steradian^{-1} }$. The dimensions will remain the same because steradian, like radian does not have dimensions.

#### Relation Between Solid and Plane Angle
Relation between Radian and Steradian. 

$$\ohm = \frac{ A }{ R^{2} } = 2\pi(1-\cos \theta)$$
where $\theta$ is semi apex angle.

![](images/Pasted image 20231212160826.png)

Solid angle or flux per unit solid angle is useful in calculating the flux through a disc.

Flux through a solid angle $\Omega$,
$$\phi = \frac{ Q \Omega }{ 4\pi \varepsilon_{o} } = kQ \Omega = kQ\ 2\pi (1 - \cos \theta)$$

# Coulomb's Law {#coulombs-law}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
It is an experimental law and it tells the electrostatic force between two point charges. It follows inverse square law. 

*The force of attraction or repulsion between 2 charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them.* 

$$f = \frac{ kq_{1}q_{2} }{ r^{2} } = \frac{ 1 }{ 4\pi\varepsilon_{o} } \frac{ q_{1}q_{2} }{ r^{2} }$$
where, $\varepsilon_{o}$ is the permittivity of free space.

$$\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}} = k = 9 \times 10^{9} \ce{\ N m^{2} C^{-2} }$$

This force acts along the line joining the two charges (central force) and is conservative and thus we can de fine potential energy for it.

![](images/Pasted image 20231018214056.png)

#### Permittivity
$\varepsilon_{o}$ is the permittivity of free space/vacuum/air.
$$\varepsilon_{o} = \frac{ 1 }{ 4\pi k } = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \ce{ \ \frac{C^{2}}{N-m^{2}} }$$

$\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of a medium and it equal to or more than $\varepsilon_{o}$. 
The more $\varepsilon$ is the less is the force applied. 

This is because when a charge is placed in a medium, the molecules around the charge are polarised which decrease the effective charge and thus the force between the charged particles. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231018215301.png)

The media which are easily polarised have high value of $\varepsilon$. 

##### Relative Permittivity 
$\varepsilon_{r}$ is the relative permittivity of medium wrt free space and is a unitless and dimensionless quantity.

$$\varepsilon_{r} = \frac{ \varepsilon  }{ \varepsilon_{o} }$$

Relative permittivity is always greater than or equal to 1. 

For air, $\varepsilon_{r} = 1$
For water, $\varepsilon_{r} = 81$
For metal, $\varepsilon_{r} \to \infty$

The value of k for any other medium,
$$k_{m} = \frac{ k }{ \varepsilon_{r} }$$
And thus the force in any other medium becomes $1 /\varepsilon_{r}$ times its value in vacuum.
$$F_{m} = \frac{ F }{ \varepsilon_{r} }$$

### Vector Form 
$$\vec{f} = \frac{ kq_{1}q_{2} }{ r^{2} }\ \hat{r}$$
$$\vec{f} = \frac{ kq_{1}q_{2} }{ r^{3} }\ \vec{r}$$
Here $q_{1},q_{2}$ are with sign and $\vec{r}$ is vector whose tail is at the charge due to  which force is to be found. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231019185547.png)

### Principle of Superposition
The net force on a charge due to multiple charges is the vector sum of all the individual forces. 

$$\vec{f}_{net} = \vec{f}_{1} + \vec{f}_{2}$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231019190621.png)


### Charge Densities

- Linear: $\lambda = \displaystyle \frac{Q}{l}$
- Areal: $\sigma = \displaystyle \frac{Q}{A}$
- Volumetric: $\rho = \displaystyle \frac{Q}{V}$

For extended object, 
- Make a small element and consider it a point charge. 
- Find this charge in terms of l, A or V. 
- Find the force using coulomb's law on this element. 
- Now integrate it over the whole body to find the net force.

# Electric Field {#electric-field}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
It is the region of space in which a charge particle or system of charges have their electric effects. 

**Electric Field Intensity ($\vec{E}$)** represents just how much the electric effects are. It quantifies the electric effect at a point and is a vector quantity. 

Popularly instead of "electric field intensity" we simply say "Electric Field."

E at a point P due to a system of charges is defined as electrostatic force experienced by test charge placed at point P, per unit test charge. Thus, E does not depend on test charge.

E is also defined as the amount of force experienced by unit +ve charge (+1 C) at a point.

That is,
$$\vec{E} = \frac{ \vec{f}_{e} }{ q_{o} }$$
If $q_{o}$ is +ve then $E \parallel f_{e}$.
If $q_{o}$ is -ve then $E \upharpoonleft \! \downharpoonright  f_{e}$.

E has Unit is N/C or V/m (Volt per meter). 

To change the electric field, we can alter charge distribution or medium.

The principle of superposition applied to electric field also.

## Electric Fields due to Various Objects
The density of field lines dictate the strength of electric field. 

Constant electric field means that the direction and distance between the field lines does not change. 

### E due to Point Charge
$$\vec{E} = \frac{ \vec{f}_{e} }{ q_{o} } = \frac{ kQ }{ r^{3} } \vec{r}$$
Here $Q$ is with sign.

And magnitude is,
$$E = \frac{ kQ }{ r^{2} }$$
Due to +ve charge, E is radially outwards and due to -ve charge, it is radially inwards. 

E is inversely proportional to (distance from charge)$^{2}$

## Electric Lines of Force (ELOF)
They are imaginary lines or curves, the tangent to which at a point provides direction of electric field at that point.

They gives pictorial representation of electric field. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231205174142.png)

**Line Density:** No. of ELOF per unit cross sectional area. 

#### Properties of ELOF
1. They are imaginary lines.

1. Electric field will be tangential to ELOF. 

1. ELOF can only originate form +ve charge or infinity.

1. ELOF can only terminate at -ve charge or infinity. 

2. Two ELOF will never intersect. 
   
 

![](images/Pasted image 20231205174636.png)

6. ELOF due to stationary charges will never make a closed loop. 
   
   This is because the line originates from a +ve charge and it cannot terminate at it.
   
   This can also be explained by the fact that if it made loops, then to travel a +ve charge on the loop, the work done will be +ve. This cannot happen as electric force is conservative and the work done should be 0 for 0 displacement.

	

![](images/Pasted image 20231205175309.png)

   
7. ELOF are always from high to low potential. 

8. Line density at any point is proportional to electric field intensity. Thus it is proportional to magnitude of electric field intensity at that point.

#### ELOF due to Various Objects 
**ELOF due to +ve point charge is radially outwards.** 

Here we can see that ratio of line density is the same as ratio of electric field. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231205180159.png)

**ELOF due to -ve point charge is radially inwards.** 

![](images/Pasted image 20231205180703.png)

No of ELOF is directly proportional to charge. In the diagram below, there are 8 ELOF for 5 $\mu$C and 16 for -10 $\mu$C.

# Ring and Disk {#ring-and-disk}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
Ring is uniform, i.e. equal lengths have equal charge.

We define a $\lambda$ here,
$$\lambda = \frac{ Q }{ 2\pi R }$$

#### At Centre 

We take a small element subtending an angle $d\theta$ at the centre. 

We can see that the field by one element is cancelled out by the element diametrically opposite to it. Thus the E at centre will be zero.

$$E_{C} = 0$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231019210551.png)

#### On Axis
We take a small charge $dQ$, due to which we have $dE$,
$$dE = \frac{ kdQ }{ (R^{2} + x^{2}) }$$
Now this has a vertical and horizontal component. The vertical is cancelled by the small charge $dQ$ diametrically opposite to the first $dQ$. 

Thus, E on axis is along it.

That is,
$$
\begin{split}
E &= \int dE \cos \theta \\
&= \int \frac{ kdQ }{ (R^{2} + x^{2}) } . \frac{ x }{ \sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } } \, dx \\
&= \frac{ kx }{ (R^{2} + x^{2})^{3/2} } \int_{0}^{Q} dQ \\
&= \frac{ kQx }{ (R^{2} + x^{2})^{3/2} } 
\end{split}
$$

Thus finally,
$$E = \frac{ kQx }{ (R^{2} + x^{2})^{3/2} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231019211856.png)

Now, if $x \gg R$, i.e. very far,
$$E_{far} = \frac{kQ}{x^{2}}$$

Again, if $x \ll R$, i.e. very near but not at centre,
$$E_{near} = \frac{ kQx }{ R^{3} }$$

#### Graph of E vs x for +vely charged Ring
E is max at $\displaystyle \frac{R}{\sqrt{ 2 }}$ and is,
$$E = \frac{ 2kQ }{ 3\sqrt{ 3 }R^{2} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231019212400.png)

## E due to Half Ring
Here, 
$$\lambda = \frac{ Q }{ \pi R }$$

#### At Centre
We take an element subtending an angle $d\theta$, $\theta$ from the diameter. 
This has charge,
$$dQ = \frac{ Q }{ \pi }d\theta$$

Due to this electric field is,
$$dE = \frac{ kQd\theta }{ \pi R^{2} }$$
Which has two components,
$$dE_{x} = dE\cos \theta$$
$$dE_{y} = dE\sin \theta$$

Now the x components cancel each other out. 
Thus,
$$
\begin{split}
E &= \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{ kQ }{ \pi R^{2} } \sin \theta \, d\theta \\
&= \frac{ 2kQ }{ \pi R^{2} }
\end{split}
$$

In terms of $\lambda$,
$$E = \frac{ 2k\lambda }{ R }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020191012.png)

#### On Axis
Here too we take elements as before. This element is at $(R\cos \theta, R\sin \theta, 0)$

We have to find E at point $(0,0,z)$, i.e.
$$\vec{r} = -R\cos \theta \hat{i} - R\sin \theta \hat{j} + z\hat{k}$$
$$r = \sqrt{ R^{2} + z^{2} }$$

Now, dE due to dQ is,
$$d\vec{E} = \frac{ k(\lambda Rd\theta)(-R\cos \theta \hat{i} - R\sin \theta \hat{j} + z\hat{k}) }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} }$$
The net E will be,
$$
\begin{split}
d\vec{E} &= \int dE_{x} + \int dE_{y} + \int dE_{z} \\
\\
\int dE_{x} &= \frac{ -k\lambda R^{2} }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} } \int_{0}^{\pi} \cos \theta \, d\theta = 0 \\
\\
\int dE_{y} &= \frac{ -k\lambda R^{2} }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} } \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin \theta \, d\theta = \frac{ -2k\lambda R^{2} }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} } \\
\\
\int dE_{y} &= \frac{ -k\lambda Rz }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} } \int_{0}^{\pi} \, d\theta = \frac{ -k\lambda z R \pi }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} } \\
\end{split}
$$
Thus the net E comes out to be,
$$\vec{E} = \frac{ -2k\lambda R^{2} }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} } \hat{j} + \frac{ k\lambda Rz\pi }{ (R^{2} + z^{2})^{3/2} } \hat{k}$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020192619.png)

Similarly we can find for quarter ring.

### E due to Arc

![](images/Pasted image 20230109153240.png)

1/4th:
$$E = \frac{ k\lambda }{ r }\sqrt{ 2 }$$

Half:
$$E = \frac{ 2k\lambda }{ r }$$


## E due to Disk
Here we define $\sigma$,
$$\sigma = \frac{ Q }{ \pi R^{2} }$$

We will take elemental rings of width dr, r distance from the centre. 
This elemental ring has charge,
$$dQ = \frac{ 2Qrdr }{ R^{2} }$$

Due to this dE is,
$$dE = \frac{ kdQx }{ (r^{2} + x^{2})^{3/2} }$$
The net E is,
$$
\begin{split}
E &= \int_{0}^{R} \frac{ k_{2}Qrdr }{ R^{2}(r^{2} + x^{2})^{3/2} } \\
&= \frac{ 2kQx }{ R^{2} } \int_{0}^{R} \frac{ rdr }{ (r^{2} + x^{2})^{3/2} } \\
&= \frac{ 2kQ }{ R^{2} } \left( 1 - \frac{ x }{ \sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } } \right)
\end{split}
$$
Thus finally,
$$E = \frac{ 2kQ }{ R^{2} } \left( 1 - \frac{ x }{ \sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } } \right)$$
$$E = \frac{ \sigma }{ 2\varepsilon_{o} } \left( 1 - \frac{ x }{ \sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } } \right)$$

We can also write this as,
$$E = \frac{ 2kQ }{ R^{2} } (1 - \cos \theta)$$
$$E = \frac{ \sigma }{ 2\varepsilon_{o} } (1 - \cos \theta)$$


Now, if $x \to 0$,
$$E_{C} = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_{o}}$$
And if $x \to \infty$,
$$E_{\infty} \to 0$$

# Wire {#wire}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
Here,
$$\lambda = \frac{ Q }{ l }$$

#### Finitely Long Wire
The top end makes angle $\theta_{1}$ and the bottom makes $\theta_{2}$.

$$
\begin{split}
E_{\perp} &= \frac{ k\lambda }{ r }(\sin \theta_{2} + \sin \theta_{2}) \\
E_{\parallel} &= \frac{ k\lambda }{ r }|\cos \theta_{2} - \cos \theta_{2}|
\end{split}
$$
The direction of parallel one is towards the part which is smaller because the other larger part will have more E than the smaller part. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231020195654.png)

##### Derivation 
We take an element of length dx, x distance from the foot of perpendicular. This is at an angle $\theta$ from the perpendicular.
This has charge,
$$dQ = \lambda dx$$

Also,
$$
\begin{split}
x &= r \tan \theta \\
dx &= r\sec^{2}\theta d\theta 
\end{split}
$$

Now, due to dQ, the dE at P is,
$$dE = \frac{ k\lambda dx }{ (r\sec \theta)^{2} }$$

Along x axis,
$$
\begin{split}
E_{x} &= \int dE\cos \theta \\
&= \int \frac{ k\lambda r\sec^{2}\theta d\theta \cos \theta }{ r^{2} \sec^{2} \theta } \\
&= \frac{ k\lambda }{ r } \int_{-\theta_{2}}^{\theta_{1}} \cos \theta \, d\theta \\
&= \frac{ k\lambda }{ r } (\sin \theta_{1} + \sin \theta_{2}) 
\end{split}
$$

Along y axis, similarly,
$$
\begin{split}
E_{y} &= \int dE\sin \theta \\
&= \frac{ k\lambda }{ r } |\cos \theta_{1} - \cos \theta_{2}|
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020200516.png)

#### Semi Infinite Wire
When one end is at $\infty$ but the other is not. 

We will find E at perpendicular point from the finite end point.

Here, since the wire if infinite, $\theta_{1} \to 90^{\circ}$ and $\theta_{2} = 0$.
Thus,
$$
\begin{split}
E_{\perp} &= \frac{ k\lambda }{ r } \\
E_{\parallel} &= \frac{ k\lambda }{ r } \\
E_{net} &= \frac{ \sqrt{ 2 }k\lambda }{ r } 
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020201354.png)

#### Infinitely Long Wire
Both the ends are at $\infty$ and hence $\theta_{1}, \theta_{2} \to 90$

Thus,
$$E_{\perp} = \frac{ 2k \lambda }{ r } = E_{net}$$
$$E_{\parallel} = 0$$

E is directed perpendicularly outward from the wire.

$$\vec{E} = \frac{ 2k\lambda }{ r^{2} } (\overline{OP})$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020201920.png)

#### Examples

![](images/Pasted image 20231020210934.png)


#### Infinitely Large Sheet
$W \to \infty$ and $l \to \infty$. 

$$E = \frac{ \sigma }{ 2 \varepsilon_{o} }$$
which is independent of x and thus unirform.

### Uniformly Charged Hollow Sphere
$$
\begin{split}
E_{in} &= 0 \\
E_\text{surface} &= \frac{ kQ }{ R^{2} } \\
E_{out} &= \frac{ kQ }{ r^{2} } \\
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020213101.png)

Thus for a point outside the shell, it behaves like a point charge,
![](images/Pasted image 20231020214146.png)

##### Graph
![](images/Pasted image 20231020213112.png)

## Uniformly Charged Solid Sphere
$$
\begin{split}
E_{in} &= \frac{ kQr }{ R^{3} } = \frac{ \rho r }{ 3\varepsilon_{o} } \\
E_\text{surface} &= \frac{ kQ }{ R^{2} } \\
E_{out} &= \frac{ kQ }{ r^{2} } \\
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020214608.png)

Here too, for outside points, uniform solid sphere behaves like a point charge placed at its centre.

#### Derivation
Here,
$$\rho = \frac{ 3Q }{ 4\pi R^{3} }$$

##### Outside 
Here we take elemental shells of dx thickness and of radius x. 
This shell has charge,
$$dQ = \frac{ 2Qx^{2}dx }{ R^{2} }$$

Now this elemental shell has field at P,
$$dE = \frac{ kdQ }{ r^{2} }$$
The net field is,
$$E = \int \frac{ kdQ }{ r^{2} } = \frac{ kQ }{ r^{2} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020215245.png)

##### Inside 
We take an elemental shell of radius x and thickness dx. 

Now we find that the E at P is only due to a solid sphere of radius r as the outside shells don't contribute to the field.

$$E = \int_{0}^{R} dE = \int_{0}^{r} dE + \cancelto{ 0 }{ \int_{r}^{R} dE }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231020220228.png)

Now this inside sphere has charge,
$$
\begin{split}
Q &= \rho V \\
&= \frac{ 3Q }{ 4\pi R^{3} } . \frac{ 4\pi r^{3} }{ 3 } \\
&= \frac{ Qr^{3} }{ R^{3} }
\end{split}
$$

Thus the field is,
$$E_{in} = \frac{ kQ_{in} }{ r^{2} } = \frac{ kQr }{ R^{3} } = \frac{ \rho r }{ 3\varepsilon_{o} }$$


#### Graph

#### Inside a Cavity
The E is constant inside a cavity if it is not concentric. 

If the cavity is concentric then the field is zero.

$$E_{cav} = \frac{ \rho }{ 3\varepsilon_{o} } (\overline{OC})$$
Since this is independent of P, the field inside the cavity is uniform.

# Electrostatic Potential {#electrostatic-potential}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
Work done by external force in bringing a unit +ve charge very slowly from infinity to a point P is called the Potential at point P.
$$or$$
Negative of work done by electric field to bring unit +ve charge from $\infty$ to point P.

$$\frac{ (W_{ext})_{\infty \to P} }{ q_{o} } = \frac{ -(W_{ele})_{\infty \to P} }{ q_{o} } = V_{P}$$

$$V_{p} = \frac{ (W_{ele})_{P \to \infty} }{ q_{o} }$$

It is a scalar quantity and can be +ve, -ve or zero.
Unit is J C$^{-1}$ = V. 

We consider electric potential to be zero at infinity.

Now,
$$
\begin{split}
V &= \frac{ -W_{ele} }{ q_{o} } \\
&= \frac{ - \int_{\infty}^{P} q_{o}\vec{E} \, d\vec{r} }{ q_{o} } \\
&= \int_{P}^{\infty} \vec{E} \, d\vec{r} \\
\end{split}
$$
This integral is called *line integral of electric field.*

## Electric Potentials due to Various Objects
### V due to Point Charge
$$
\begin{split}
V &= \frac{ (W_{ele})_{P \to \infty} }{ q_{o} } \\
&= \frac{ \int_{P}^{\infty} q_{o}E \, dr }{ q_{o} } \\
&= \int_{r}^{\infty} \frac{ kQ }{ x^{2} } \, dx \\
&= \frac{ kQ }{ r }
\end{split}
$$
Thus,
$$V = \frac{ kQ }{ r }$$

Here, Q should be put with sign. And thus for +ve Q, V will be +ve, -ve for -ve and 0 for 0. 

#### Graph 

![](images/Pasted image 20231021171844.png)

### Potential due to Ring
[[02.1 Ring and Disk|E due to Ring and Disk]]

##### At Centre 
We take a small charge dQ on the ring. 
Due to this we have potential,
$$dV = \frac{ kdQ }{ R }$$

Thus,
$$V_{C} = \frac{ kQ }{ R }$$
This is valid even if the ring has non uniformly distributed charge. 

This kQ/R is the potential for the centre of any arc as well. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231021172427.png)

#### On axis
We again take a small charge dQ on the ring. 
Due to this the potential will be,
$$dV = \frac{ kdQ }{ \sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } }$$

Now every charge on the ring has equal distance from the point and thus,
$$V = \frac{ kQ }{ \sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } }$$

This is valid even if the charge is non uniformly distributed. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231021172959.png)

#### Graph 
![](images/Pasted image 20231021173206.png)


### Potential due to Uniform Disk
Here,
$$\sigma = \frac{ Q }{ \pi R^{2} }$$

We take elemental rings of radius r and thickness dr. This ring has charge,
$$dQ = 2\sigma \pi r dr = \frac{ 2Qrdr }{ R^{2} }$$

The potential due to this ring will be,
$$
\begin{split}
dV &= \frac{ kdQ }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + x^{2} } } \\
&= \frac{ 2k Q }{ R^{2} }\frac{ rdr }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + x^{2} } }
\end{split}
$$

The net potential is,
$$
\begin{split}
V &= \frac{ 2kQ }{ R^{2} } \int_{0}^{R} \frac{ rdr }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + x^{2} } } \\
&= \frac{ 2kQ }{ R^{2} } (\sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } - x) 
\end{split}
$$
After rationalisation,
$$V = \frac{ 2kQ }{ \sqrt{ R^{2} + x^{2} } + x }$$

In terms of $\sigma$
$$V_{P} = \frac{ \sigma }{ 2\varepsilon_{o} }(\sqrt{ R^{2}+x^{2} } - x)$$

For a very near point,
$$V_{near} = \frac{ 2kQ }{ R }$$
For a very far point,
$$V_{far} \to 0$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231021174252.png)

#### Graph 
![](images/Pasted image 20231021174415.png)

### Potential Due to Sphere
For an outside point, sphere behaves like a point charge with all the charge at its centre. 

#### Hollow Sphere
Here,
$$\sigma = \frac{ Q }{ 4\pi R^{2} }$$

Potentials will be,
$$
\begin{split}
V_{in} &= \frac{ kQ }{ R } = V_\text{centre} \\
V_\text{surface} &= \frac{ kQ }{ R } \\
V_\text{out} &= \frac{ kQ }{ r } \\
\end{split}
$$
Since there is no electric field inside, $V_\text{surface} = V_{in}$

![](images/Pasted image 20231021180518.png)

$V_\text{centre} = kQ /R$ even if the charge is non uniformly distributed. 

##### Graph 
![](images/Pasted image 20231024200859.png)


#### Solid Sphere

$$
\begin{split}
V_{in} &= \frac{ kQ }{ 2R^{3} } (3R^{2} - r^{2}) \\
V_\text{centre} &= \frac{3}{2} \frac{ KQ }{ R } \\
V_\text{surface} &= \frac{ kQ }{ R } \\
V_\text{out} &= \frac{ kQ }{ r } 
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231024201204.png)

##### Derivation for Inside 
We take two elemental shells of thickness dx and radius, one when x < r and one when x > r. 

These shells will have charge,
$$dQ = \frac{ 3Qx^{2}dx }{ R^{3} }$$

Thus potential,
$$
\begin{split}
V &= \int_{0}^{R} dV = \int_{0}^{r} dV + \int_{r}^{R} dV \\
&= \int \frac{ kdQ }{ r } + \int \frac{ kdQ }{ x } \\
&= \frac{ k 3Q }{ R^{3}r } \int_{0}^{r} x^{2} \, dx + \frac{ k 3Q }{ R^{2} } \int_{r}^{R} x \, dx \\
&= \frac{ kQr^{2} }{ R^{3} } + \frac{ 3kQ }{ 2R } - \frac{ 3kQr^{2} }{ 2R^{3} } 
\end{split}
$$

# Potential Difference {#potential-difference}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
$$
\begin{split}
V_{BA} &= V_{B} - V_{A} \\
&= \frac{ (W_{ext})_{A \to B} }{q_{o}} \\
&= \frac{ -(W_{ele})_{A \to B} }{ q_{o} } \\
&= \frac{ (W_{ele})_{B \to A} }{ q_{o} }
\end{split}
$$

Potential difference between points B and A is defined as work done by external agent against electrostatic forces to bring unit +ve charge from A to B, slowly.

Thus,
$$
\begin{split}
\Delta V &= - \int_{A}^{B} \vec{E} \, d\vec{r}\\
&= \int_{B}^{A} \vec{E} \, d\vec{r} \\
\end{split}
$$

Or,
$$dV = -\vec{E}.d\vec{r}$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231024204046.png)

#### Relation between Field and Potential 
[[03.2 Potential Energy#PE and Force Relation]]

From the above result, we can write,
$$\Delta V = -\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} E_{x} \, dx - \int_{y_{i}}^{y_{f}} E_{y} \, dy - \int_{z_{i}}^{z_{f}} E_{z} \, dz$$

And to find field,
$$E = -\frac{ \partial V }{ \partial x } \hat{i} - \frac{ \partial V }{ \partial y } \hat{j} - \frac{ \partial V }{ \partial z }\hat{k}$$
This can be written as,
$$E = - \left( \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x } \hat{i} + \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y } \hat{j} + \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z } \hat{k} \right) V$$
$$E = - \nabla V$$

Similar to [[03 Energy#Potential Energy from Force]]

### PD in Uniform Field
##### Perpendicular to the Field 
If displacement is perpendicular to the field, then the PD will be zero. 

In a perpendicular plane to the electric field, the potentials at every point is the same and thus the PD is zero. This plane is thus called **Equipotential Surface.** And there is no work done in moving a charge on this plane. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231024205453.png)

##### Along the Field 
If displacement is along the field, the potential decreases.
$$V_{B} - V_{A} = \frac{ q_{o}E d\cos 0 }{ q_{o} }$$
$$V_{B} - V_{A} = Ed$$
Thus field is from lower to higher potential. 

Thus,
$$E = \frac{ \Delta V }{ d }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231024205723.png)

##### Any Direction 
$$
\begin{split}
V_{B} - V_{A} &= \frac{ q_{o}E d \cos \theta }{ q_{o} } \\
&= Ed\cos \theta \\
&= \vec{E} . \vec{d} \\
&= \vec{E} d_{\parallel}
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231024205945.png)   
   

## PD due to Various Objects
#### Point Charge 
$$V_{B} - V_{A} = kQ \left( \frac{ 1 }{ r_{B} } - \frac{ 1 }{ r_{A} } \right)$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231024210638.png)

#### Infinite Non Conducting Sheet
[[03.2 Wire#Infinitely Large Sheet]]

$$V_{A} - V_{C} = \frac{ \sigma d }{ 2 \varepsilon_{o} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231024210941.png)

If the direction is not parallel to the field,
$$V_{A} - V_{D} = \frac{ \sigma x\cos \theta }{ 2 \varepsilon_{o} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231024211032.png)

#### Infinitely Long Wire (Line Charge)

If displacement is perpendicular to the field, i.e. parallel to the wire, the potential difference will be zero. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127190540.png)

If charge is displaced perpendicular to the wire,
$$
\begin{split}
dW &= \frac{ 2k\lambda q_{o} }{ r } dr \cos 0^{\circ} \\
W &= 2k\lambda q_{o} \int_{r_{A}}^{r_{B}} \frac{ 1 }{ r } \, dr
\end{split}
$$
Thus giving,
$$V_{A} - V_{B} = 2k\lambda \log\frac{ r_{B} }{ r_{A} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231127191059.png)

## Equipotential Surface 
Surface, real or imaginary, on which all points have the same potential. 

The potential difference between any two points will be zero. Thus, work done by electric field to move charge on equipotential surface is zero. 

If we move the charge slowly, the work done by external agent will also be zero. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127191251.png)

If work done is zero, there are two possibilities,
1. Electric field may be zero at equipotential surface.
2. Electric field may be perpendicular to the equipotential surface.
   
 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127191834.png)

*Two distinct equipotential surfaces can never intersect.* 
This is because,
1. We cannot define two potentials at the same point.
2. Electric field cannot have two directions at the same point. 
   
 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127192035.png)
   
   Note that if the equipotential surface is the same, it can intersect itself. At the point of intersection, the field is zero. 
   
 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127192305.png)

#### Eq. Surface due to Point Charge 
For a point charge equipotential surface is a spherical shell centred at the charge of radius r. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127193007.png)

The equipotential surfaces are concentric spherical shells. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127193502.png)

#### Eq. Surface due to Infinitely Large Sheet 
Equipotential surface is plane parallel to the sheet. 

If electric field is uniform, the equipotential surfaces are planar.

![](images/Pasted image 20231127193724.png)

An example,
![](images/Pasted image 20231127194931.png)

#### Eq. Surface due to Infinitely Long Wire
Here the equipotential surface is hollow cylinder with the wire as axis.

# Electric Potential Energy {#electric-potential-energy}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
It is the work done by external agent, or -ve of work done by electric field to bring the charges slowly from infinity to form the system. 

$$U = [W_{ext}(\infty \to P)]_{\Delta K = 0}$$
$$U = V_{sys} . q$$

Multiplying potential with charge gives potential energy. Similar to force and field. 
![](images/Pasted image 20231127202309.png)


It is a scalar and its SI unit is Joule. 
Another unit is eV called *Electron Volt,* which is,
$$1\ eV = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ J$$

We consider potential energy at infinity to be zero. 

Electric potential energy can be used by any of, or all of, the charges in the system. 

We can write V due to any of the charges and q of any of the charges. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127204038.png)

## EPE of Various Systems 
One interaction between two charges will have one potential energy.

#### EPE of 2 Point Charges 
$$U = \frac{ kQ_{1}Q_{2} }{ r }$$
where $Q_{1},Q_{2}$ are with signs. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231127204330.png)

#### EPE due to System of Charges 
Charges here are considered point charges. 

$$
\begin{split}
U_{sys} &= [W_{ext}(\infty \to \text{Here})]_{\Delta K = 0} \\
&= (U_{12} + U_{13} + U_{14} + \dots + U_{1n}) \\
&\ + (U_{23} + U_{24} + \dots + U_{2n}) \\
&\ + (U_{34} + \dots + U_{4n}) \\
&\ \ \ \vdots\\
&\ + U_{(n-1)n} 
\end{split}
$$
This has $(n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + \dots + 1$ terms, i.e. 
$$\ce{ no. of terms } = \frac{ n(n-1) }{ 2 }$$

Each interaction between two charges contributes a term. Thus n charges will have ${}^{n}C_{2}$ terms.

If there are 3 point charges, then there will be 3 terms. 
$$U = U_{12} + U_{13} + U_{23}$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231127213632.png)

##### 3 Point Charge System
EPE for an equilateral triangle made of equal point charges will be,
$$U = \frac{ 2kQ^{2} }{ l }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231127213913.png)

#### Symmetric Systems
For a symmetric system,
$$U = \frac{ n }{ 2 } \times \text{PE of any one charge with all other charges}$$
where n is the number of charges.

Division by 2 is to remove repetitions.

# Self Energy {#self-energy}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
It is the potential energy stored in a body by virtue of interaction between various charge particles inside the body. 

It is a kind of electrostatic potential energy. 

Total electrostatic potential energy of a system is given by,
$$U_\text{total} = U_\text{self energy} + U_\text{interaction}$$
$U_\text{self}$ is to be written of all charges.

#### Point Charge
Since there is no other charge and hence no other interaction,
$$U_\text{self energy} = 0$$

### Hollow Sphere
Uniformly Charged 

$$
\begin{split}
U_\text{system} &= W_{ext}(\infty \to \text{here}) \\
dW &= Vdq \\
&= \frac{ kq }{ R }dq \\
W &= \int_{0}^{Q} \frac{ kq }{ R } \, dq \\
&= \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2R }  
\end{split}
$$
This is the self energy of hollow sphere. 
$$U_\text{self} = \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2R }$$
Thus increasing the radius decreases self energy. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231203144420.png)


### Solid Sphere
Uniformly charged.

We will bring charges from $\infty$ to their place and form the sphere. 

Now, while making the big sphere, a smaller sphere of radius of r is formed.
This sphere has charge,
$$q = \frac{ Q }{ R^{3} }r^{3}$$
where Q is the charge to be of the big sphere. 

Now, a small charge dq will be,
$$dq = \frac{ Q }{ R^{3} } 3r^{2}dr$$

To bring this small charge dq from $\infty$ to the sphere and spreading it uniformly, increasing the radius by dr, work done will be,
$$
\begin{split}
dW &= Vdq \\
&= \frac{ kq }{ r }dq \\
&= \frac{ kQr^{3} }{ R^{3}r }. \frac{ Q }{ R^{3} }. 3r^{2}dr \\
&= \frac{ 3kQ^{2} }{ R^{6} } r^{4}dr
\end{split}
$$

This gives,
$$
\begin{split}
W_{ext} &= \int_{0}^{R}  \, dW \\
&= \frac{ 3kQ^{2} }{ R^{6} } \int_{0}^{R} r^{4} \, dr \\
&= \frac{ 3kQ^{2} }{ 5R } 
\end{split}
$$

Which is the self energy of solid sphere,
$$U_\text{self} = \frac{ 3kQ^{2} }{ 5R } = \frac{ 0.6kQ^{2} }{ R }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231203151129.png)

For example,
![](images/Pasted image 20231203151419.png)

## Energy Density
Wherever there is a conservative field, there will be energy corresponding to that field. This energy per unit volume is Energy Density. 

We can define gravitational, electrical and magnetic ED. 

$$u = \frac{ dU }{ dV }$$
And its unit will be $\ce{ J m^{-3} }$.


Electric energy density is, in any medium,
$$\frac{ dU }{ dV } = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon E^{2}$$
And in air/vacuum,
$$\frac{ dU }{ dV } = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{o} E^{2}$$

Here we can see that,
$$\frac{ dU }{ dV } \propto E^{2}$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231203152918.png)

![](images/Pasted image 20231204162053.png)

For a system,
$$\int \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{o}E^{2}  \, dV = U_\text{epe}$$
This energy due to electric field is the same as electric potential energy (epe or self energy) of the system. 

#### Energy due to Field of Hollow Sphere 

Since there is no field inside the sphere, there is no energy density. Thus no energy is present inside the sphere. 

For outside, we make an elemental shell of thickness dr and radius r. This elemental shell has the same magnitude of field at every point. Thus it will have same energy density,
$$\frac{ dU }{ dV } = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }\varepsilon_{o} \frac{ k^{2}Q^{2} }{ r^{4} }$$
Giving,
$$
\begin{split}
dU &= \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }\varepsilon_{o} \frac{ k^{2}Q^{2} }{ r^{4} } 4\pi r^{2} dr \\
dU &= \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2r^{2} } dr 
\end{split}
$$

Integrating this will give energy due to hollow sphere,
$$
\begin{split}
U &= \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2 } \int_{R}^{\infty} \frac{ 1 }{ r^{2} } \, dr \\
&= \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2R } 
\end{split}
$$
This is same as the self energy of hollow sphere. 

This means that self energy is the energy which is stored in the electric field due to an object. 
I.e. electric potential is stored in the form of electric field. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231204162952.png)

#### Energy due to Field of Solid Sphere 
Outside the sphere, since the field is the same, the energy will also be the same as that of hollow sphere. 
$$U_\text{out} = \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2R }$$

Now for inside, we take an elemental sphere of radius r and thickness dr. This will have energy density,
$$\frac{ dU }{ dV } = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }\frac{ \varepsilon_{o} k^{2} Q^{2} r^{2} }{ R^{6} }$$
Giving,
$$
\begin{split}
dU &= \frac{ \varepsilon_{o} k^{2} Q^{2} r^{2} }{ 2R^{6} }. 4\pi r^{2} dr \\
U &= \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2R^{6} } \int_{0}^{R} r^{4}dr \\
&= \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 10R }
\end{split}
$$
Thus we get,
$$U_{in} = \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 10R }$$

The total energy will be,
$$U = \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 10R } + \frac{ kQ^{2} }{ 2R } = \frac{ 3kQ^{2} }{ 5R }$$
Which is the same as the self energy of solid sphere.

# Electric Dipole {#electric-dipole}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
Electric dipole is an electrically neutral system consisting of two equal an opposite charges placed at a very small separation. 

Separation between charges should be small in relation to the separation between dipole and the point of interest. 

#### Electric Dipole Moment 
The vector joining -q to +q is $\vec{l}$. 

Dipole moment is represented by $\vec{p}$ and is defined as,
$$\vec{p} = q . \vec{l}$$
Its unit is $\ce{ C m }$ or debye and dimensions are $\ce{ [ITL] }$
Also, $1 \text{debye} = 3.3 \times 10^{-30} \ce{\ C m }$


Its direction is opposite to that of electric field, i.e. from the -ve to the +ve charge. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231204165635.png)

We can divide a charge to form dipole. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231204165852.png)

We can use "centre of charge" similar to [[01 Centre of Mass]] to club charges together. #important 

![](images/Pasted image 20231204170217.png)

But this clubbing, i.e. "centre of charge" can only be done in calculation of dipole moment. This is because both dipole moment and mass moment are defined in a similar way. 

#### Finding dipole moment 
To find dipole moment of continuous bodies,
![](images/Pasted image 20231204170705.png)

Using the concept of "centre of charge",
![](images/Pasted image 20231204170815.png)

![](images/Pasted image 20231204171103.png)

## Electric Field due to Dipole
The line along which dipole is placed is called axis of dipole.

The perpendicular line to axis is called equatorial line and it passes through the middle of the dipole. 

#### Axis
Electric field on axis is along dipole moment. 
I.e. 
$$\vec{E}_\text{axial} \parallel \vec{p}$$

This electric field is,
$$
\begin{split}
E_{net} &= E_{+} - E_{-} \\
&= \frac{ kq }{ (r-a)^{2} } - \frac{ kq }{ (r-a)^{2} }\\
&= \frac{ 4arkq }{ (r^{2} - a^{2})^{2} } \\
&= \frac{ 2kpr }{ (r^{2} - a^{2})^{2} } 
\end{split}
$$
Using assumption, $2a \ll r$,
$$E_\text{axis} = \frac{ 2kp }{ r^{3} }$$

In vector form,
$$E_\text{axis} = \frac{ 2k\vec{p} }{ r^{3} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231204173722.png)

#### Equatorial Plane 
From the diagram, we can see that the perpendicular components of field cancel and thus the electric field is anti parallel to dipole moment.
I.e.
$$\vec{E}_\text{equa} \upharpoonleft \! \downharpoonright \vec{p}$$

Now,
$$E = \frac{ kq }{ (r^{2} + a^{2}) }$$
Thus,
$$
\begin{split}
E_{net} &= 2E\cos \theta \\
&= \frac{ 2kq }{ (r^{2} + a^{2}) } \frac{ q }{ \sqrt{ r^{2} + a^{2} } } \\
&= \frac{ kp }{ (r^{2} + a^{2})^{3/2} } 
\end{split}
$$
Using assumption $2a \ll r$,
$$E_\text{equa} = \frac{ kp }{ r^{3} }$$

In vector form,
$$\vec{E}_\text{equa} = - \frac{ k\vec{p} }{ r^{3} }$$
The -ve indicates direction opposite to that of $\vec{p}$.

![](images/Pasted image 20231204174509.png)

Also,
![](images/Pasted image 20231204175343.png)

#### Any General Point 

This point is r distance from the centre of the dipole and makes an angle $\theta$ with the direction of dipole moment. 

We will break the dipole moment into two rectangular components. One parallel and one perpendicular to the line joining the point and centre. 

For $p\cos \theta$, the electric field is,
$$E_{\parallel} = \frac{ 2kp\cos \theta }{ r^{3} }$$
For $p\sin \theta$, the electric field is,
$$E_{\perp} = \frac{ kp\sin \theta }{ r^{3} }$$

Thus the net electric field is,
$$
\begin{split}
E_{net} &= \sqrt{ E_{\parallel}^{2} + E_{\perp}^{2} } \\
&= \frac{ kp }{ r^{3} } \sqrt{ \sin ^{2}\theta + 4\cos ^{2}\theta } \\
&= \frac{ kp }{ r^{3} } \sqrt{ 1 + 3\cos ^{2}\theta } 
\end{split}
$$

Now, $\phi$ is angle between $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{E}_{net}$. 
$$
\begin{split}
\tan \phi &= \frac{ E_{\perp} }{ E_{\parallel} } \\
&= \frac{ \tan \theta }{ 2 }
\end{split}
$$

And, the angle between $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{E}_{net}$ will be,
$$\angle = \theta + \phi = \theta + \tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{ \tan \theta }{ 2 } \right)$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231205150434.png)

For example,
![](images/Pasted image 20231205151202.png)

## Potential due to Small Dipole
Close to the +ve charge, or on the side of +ve charge, the potential will be +ve. Similarly for the -ve charge.

On the equatorial plane, the potential will be zero as it is equidistant from both charges. 
Thus the equatorial plane is an Equipotential Surface. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231205151710.png)

#### At axis
$$
\begin{split}
V_{p} &= V_{+} + V_{-} \\
&= \frac{ kq }{ (r-a) } + \frac{ k(-q) }{ (r+a) } \\
&= \frac{ kq(2a) }{ r^{2} - a^{2} } \\
&= \frac{ kp }{ r^{2} - a^{2} }
\end{split}
$$

Using the assumption, $a \ll r$,
$$V = \frac{ kp }{ r^{2} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231205152015.png)

#### Any General Point
Dividing $\vec{p}$ into two components like before, we see that point P is equatorial for $p\sin \theta$ and axial for $p\cos \theta$. 

Thus,
$$V_{p} = \frac{ kp\cos \theta }{ r^{2} }$$

In vector form,
$$V = \frac{ k\ \vec{p} . \vec{r} }{ r^{3} }$$

# Dipole in Field {#dipole-in-field}

\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
There is no external force on the dipole and thus $a_{com} = 0$.

But due to [[05 ME, force Couple and POAF#Force Couple|force couple,]] there will be torque on the dipole. 

This torque will be,
$$
\begin{split}
\uptau &= QE(l \sin \theta) \\
&= pE\sin \theta
\end{split}
$$

In vector form,
$$
\begin{split}
\vec{\tau} &= \vec{p} \times \vec{E}
\end{split}
$$

For angular acceleration,
$$
\begin{split}
\uptau &= I\alpha \\
&= I_\text{hinge} \alpha \\
&= I_\text{com} \alpha
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231205160549.png)

#### Equilibrium Positions 

The one when $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ is stable and the one when $\theta = 180^{\circ}$ is unstable. 

This can be found by slightly rotating the dipole and then checking if it rotates further or comes back to initial position. 

Oscillatory motion of dipole is possible about $\theta = 0$ because it is stable equilibrium position. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231205161203.png)

![](images/Pasted image 20231205161404.png)

#### Angular SHM
[[05 Angular SHM]]

When dipole is rotated from the equilibrium position by an angle $\theta$, it experiences a restoring torque,
$$\uptau = pE\sin \theta$$

Now for small angles, $\sin \theta \sim \theta$,
$$\uptau = pE \theta$$
I.e. $\uptau \propto \theta$ and thus it is performing angular SHM. 

For time period,
$$
\begin{split}
\uptau &= pE \theta \\
I\alpha &= pE \\
\alpha &= \frac{ pE }{ I } \theta \\
\omega &= \sqrt{ \frac{ pE }{ I } } \\
T &= 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ I }{ pE } }
\end{split}
$$

If the dipole is hinged, 
$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ I_{H} }{ pE } }$$
If the dipole is not hinged, 
$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{ I_{com} }{ pE } }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231205162608.png)

Take care to write the correct moment of inertia of the system.

### Potential Energy 
of dipole placed in uniform electric field. 

The PE of dipole will be the same as the PE of the two charges of the dipole in the electric field. 

$$
\begin{split}
U &= QV_{1} + (-Q)V_{2} \\
&= Q(V_{1} - V_{2}) \\
&= -QEl\cos \theta \\
&= -pE\cos \theta 
\end{split}
$$

In terms of vectors,
$$U = -\vec{p} . \vec{E}$$

## Dipole in Non Uniform Field

Dipole is placed along electric field. 

The dipole is of length dx.

Now, force on this dipole,
$$
\begin{split}
f &= Q(E + dE) - QE \\
&= QdE \\
&= Qdx \frac{ dE }{ dx } \\
&= p \frac{ dE }{ dx } 
\end{split}
$$

Thus,
$$f = p \frac{ dE }{ dx } $$

# Electric Flux & Gauss Law {#electric-flux--gauss-law}
\etocsettocstyle{\textbf{Chapter Contents}\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}{\par\rule{\linewidth}{0.5pt}}
\localtableofcontents
\noindent {}
[[02 Electric Field#Electric Lines of Force (ELOF)]]

It is a physical quantity which represents no. of ELOF passing through a surface area. 

The more ELOF are passing though a surface, the more flux there is.

![](images/Pasted image 20231205182340.png)

Consider a small area, whose area vector is $d\vec{s}$. An electric field which makes an angle $\theta$ with the area vector. 

Now, the component of this E which is perpendicular to the area vector is tangential to the surface and thus does not pass through it.

The component of E along ds is contributing to the no. of ELOF and thus the flux. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231205182735.png)

Thus we get, small flux through this small surface,
$$
\begin{split}
d\phi &= E\cos \theta. ds \\
&= \vec{E} . d\vec{s} \\
&= \vec{E}_{\parallel} ds
\end{split}
$$

For an extended surface,
$$\phi = \int \vec{E} . d\vec{s} $$
This is called **Surface integral of Electric Field.**

If E is uniform,
$$\phi = \vec{E}.\vec{S} = ES\cos \theta$$
where $\vec{ S }$ is the area vector.

Unit of flux is $\ce{ N C^{-1} m^{2} }$ or $\ce{ Vm }$ and it has dimensions $\ce{ [ML^{3}T^{-3}I^{-1}] }$.

Since it is a scalar product of two vectors, flux is a scalar quantity. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231211173345.png)

![](images/Pasted image 20231211174221.png)
![](images/Pasted image 20231211174232.png)

For a 3D curved surface, we will use projection of the surface (cross sectional area),
![](images/Pasted image 20231212150952.png)

### Flux due to Point Charge
$\oint$ represents closed surface, i.e. closed integral.

$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \oint \vec{E} . \, d\vec{s} \\
&= \oint Eds \cos \theta \\
&= \oint Eds \\
&= E \oint ds in\\
&= E 4\pi R^{2} \\
&= \frac{ kQ }{ R^{2} } 4\pi R^{2} \\
&= 4\pi kQ 
\end{split}
$$

Thus, for a point charge,
$$\phi = \frac{ Q }{ \varepsilon_{o} }$$
where Q is with sign. This is independent of radius of sphere, R.

Flux going out of a surface is +ve and going into it is -ve. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231212151504.png)

##### Some PTR
The ELOF which pass through smaller sphere, also pass through the bigger sphere and thus the amount of flux through them is the same. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231212152631.png)

This also works for non concentric spheres as no ELOF disappears as we move from the smaller to the bigger sphere.

![](images/Pasted image 20231212152809.png)

Thus, for any closed surface, if there is a charge inside the surface, the flux passing through it will be $\phi = Q /\varepsilon_{o}$.

![](images/Pasted image 20231212153227.png)

If charge is not inside the closed surface, the flux through the surface will be zero as the lines which enter will also leave. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231212153703.png)

## Gauss Law
aka **Gauss Theorem**

Flux emitted by a charge Q is equal to $\displaystyle \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_{o}}$. 

Closed surface is called **Gaussian Surface.**

If there is no charge inside a gaussian surface, the flux through it is zero. 

*Surface integral of electric field on a closed surface is always equal to charge enclosed per unit permittivity of free space.*

That is, the total flux through a gaussian surface is equal to the total charge inside divided by $\varepsilon_{o}$.

$$\phi = \frac{ Q_{in} }{ \varepsilon_{o} }$$
where $Q_{in}$ is with sign.

![](images/Pasted image 20231212154419.png)

If flux is zero, it does not mean that electric field is zero. However, if E is zero, flux must be zero.

The total flux is equally distributed through all the faces of a 3D shape if charge is placed at the centre.

![](images/Pasted image 20231212154808.png)

To use symmetry, the shapes we are dividing the flux among must be the same for the charge (i.e. same E through them, same distance from charge).

![](images/Pasted image 20231212155133.png)

If charge is placed at surface or vertex or edge, we will consider the point charge as a small sphere.

#### Uniform Hollow Sphere
[[03.3 Sphere#Uniformly Charged Hollow Sphere]]

##### Outside 
We consider a gaussian surface of radius r.

Now, flux is
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \oint \vec{E}. d\vec{s} \\
&= \oint Eds.\cos 0\\
&= E \oint ds \\
&= E. 4\pi r^{2} 
\end{split}
$$
Using gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ Q }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E. 4 \pi r^{2} &= \frac{ Q }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E &= \frac{ 1 }{ 4\pi\varepsilon_{o} } \frac{ Q }{ r^{2} } \\
&= \frac{ kQ }{ r^{2} }
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231213183327.png)

##### Inside 
Like before, we make a gaussian surface of radius r. 

Now, flux can be written as,
$$\phi = E 4\pi r^{2}$$
Using gauss law,
$$\phi = 0$$

Thus giving,
$$E_{in} = 0$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231213183525.png)

#### Uniform Solid Sphere 
[[03.3 Sphere#Uniformly Charged Hollow Sphere]]

Outside will be the same as that of hollow sphere.

Here, charge density,
$$\rho = \frac{ 3Q }{ 4\pi R^{3} }$$

##### Inside 
We make a gaussian surface of radius r.

Now, flux through this surface,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \oint \vec{E}. d\vec{s} \\
&= E \oint ds \\
&= E. 4 \pi r^{2}
\end{split}
$$

Charge inside the gaussian surface will be,
$$
\begin{split}
Q_{in} &= \rho \frac{ 4 }{ 3 } \pi r^{3} \\
&= \frac{ Qr^{3} }{ R^{3} }
\end{split}
$$

Using gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ Q_{in} }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
&= \frac{ \rho 4\pi r^{3} }{ 3\varepsilon_{o} } \\
&= \frac{ Qr^{3} }{ R^{3} \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E. 4\pi r^{2} &= \frac{ \rho 4\pi r^{3} }{ 3 } \\
E. 4\pi r^{2} &= \frac{ Qr^{3} }{ R^{3} \varepsilon_{o} }
\end{split} 
$$

Thus giving,
$$E = \frac{ \rho r }{ 3 \varepsilon_{o} } = \frac{ 1 }{ 4\pi\varepsilon_{o} } \frac{ Qr }{ R^{3} }$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231213184313.png)

#### Large Non Conducting Sheet
[[03.2 Wire#Infinitely Large Sheet]]

We make a cylindrical and symmetrical gaussian surface.

Flux can be given as,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \oint \vec{E} . d\vec{s}\\
&= \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} + \phi_{3} \\
&= ES \cos 0 + ES \cos 0 + 0 \\
&= 2ES
\end{split}
$$

Using gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ \sigma S }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
2ES &= \frac{ \sigma S }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E &= \frac{ \sigma }{ 2 \varepsilon_{o} }

$$

Which is uniform E.

#### Infinitely Long Wire
[[03.2 Wire#Infinitely Long Wire]]

We will make a cylindrical gaussian surface, axis of which is the wire. 

Flux is given as,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} + \phi_{3} \\
&= 0 + 0 + \int \vec{E} \, d\vec{s} \\
&= E \int ds \\
&= E. 2\pi rl   
\end{split}
$$

Using gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ \lambda l }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E. 2\pi rl &= \frac{ \lambda l }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E &= \frac{ \lambda }{ 2\pi \varepsilon_{o} r } \\
&= \frac{ 2k\lambda }{ r }
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231213185331.png)

#### Long Hollow Cylindrical 
Infinitely long and having radius R. 

Here,
$$
\begin{split}
Q &= \lambda l \\
&= \sigma 2 \pi R l \\
\lambda &= \sigma 2\pi R
\end{split}
$$
Where $\lambda, \sigma$ mean charge per unit length and area. 

##### Inside  
We make a smaller cylindrical gaussian surface of radius r.

Flux is,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} + \phi_{3} \\
&= 0 + 0 + E. 2\pi rl
\end{split}
$$

Using gauss law,
$$\phi = 0$$
Thus giving,
$$E_{in} = 0$$

There will be no E due to infinitely long uniformly charged cylinder at inside point.

##### Outside
We make a larger cylindrical gaussian surface of radius r.

Flux will be,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} + \phi_{3} \\
&= 0 + 0 + E 2\pi rl\\
&= E. 2\pi rl
\end{split}
$$

Using gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ \lambda l }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
&= \frac{ \sigma. 2\pi rl }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E &= \frac{ \lambda }{ 2\pi \varepsilon_{o} r } \\
&= \frac{ 2k\lambda }{ r }
\end{split}
$$
Which is the same that of infinitely long wire. 

Thus long hollow cylinder acts like an infinite wire placed at its axis for outside point.

In terms of $\sigma$,
$$E = \frac{ \sigma R }{ \varepsilon_{o} r }$$

in Electrostatic Conditions i.e. when the charge is at rest.

[[00 Electrostatics#Conductor]]

Here, we will consider a conductor to be a metal.

When field is applied on a conductor, the free e are the only ones that move.

![](images/Pasted image 20231213193457.png)

### Properties of Conductors 
1. If a metal has no charge in cavity, then any charge given will reside on the outer surface. 

	In non metals, charge can stay in bulk (i.e. inside).
	
	

![](images/Pasted image 20231213193733.png)
	
	Metals behave like hollow object in terms of electrostatic properties.
	
	

![](images/Pasted image 20231213194333.png)
	$\\$

2. Net electric field in the bulk of conductor is always zero in electrostatic conditions. 
	$$or$$
	ELOF will not enter inside a conductor.
	
	This is because in electrostatic conditions, in the conductor, external field and induced fields are equal and opposite and cancel each other.
	
	

![](images/Pasted image 20231213194813.png)
	$\\$

3. Field at the surface of conductor is always normal to it.
	$$or$$
	ELOF always strike normally at the conductor. 
	
	

![](images/Pasted image 20231213200121.png)
	$\\$

4. Conductor has equal potential at each point of it. 
	$$or$$
	Conductor is an equipotential surface. 
	
	Since there is no field inside, there is no work done in moving charge from point A to B. Work done in moving a charge on the surface is also zero as the field is perpendicular to displacement. 
	Thus $\Delta V = 0$ and conductor becomes equipotential surface.

### Field at the Surface of Conductor 
Here we have $\sigma$ which is *local charge density.*

We will take a cylindrical gaussian surface at the surface. 

The flux can be written as,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} + \phi_{3} \\
&= 0 + 0 + ES
\end{split}
$$

By gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ \sigma S }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
ES &= \frac{ \sigma S }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E &= \frac{ \sigma }{ \varepsilon_{o} }
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231213201136.png)

##### Local Charge Density
$$\sigma \propto \frac{ 1 }{ \text{Radius of Curvature} }$$
This means that at the nooks and crannies, the charge density will be high. I.e. the shape edges will produce more electric field.

![](images/Pasted image 20231213201459.png)

### Electrostatic Pressure
Any charge on the surface of the conductor experiences a repulsive force due to the other charges. This force per unit area is called electrostatic pressure.

$$P = \frac{ \sigma^{2} }{ 2\varepsilon_{o} }$$
where $\sigma$ is local charge density.

$$

If $Q_{1} /R_{1} > Q_{2} /R_{2}$, then final charge on the spheres, $q_{1},q_{2}$

Equating final voltages,
$$
\begin{split}
V = \frac{ kq_{1} }{ R_{1} } &= \frac{ kq_{2} }{ R_{2} } \\
\frac{ q_{1} }{ q_{2} } &= \frac{ R_{1} }{ R_{2} }
\end{split}
$$
Using conservation of charge,
$$Q_{1} + Q_{2} = q_{1} + q_{2}$$

Thus giving,
$$
\begin{split}
q_{1} &= \frac{ R_{1} }{ R_{1} + R_{2} } (Q_{1} + Q_{2}) \\
q_{2} &= \frac{ R_{2} }{ R_{1} + R_{2} } (Q_{1} + Q_{2}) \\
\end{split}
$$
i.e. shells *share charge proportional to their radii.*

![](images/Pasted image 20231214195123.png)

Now,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ q_{1} }{ q_{2} } &= \frac{ R_{1} }{ R_{2} } \\
\frac{ \sigma_{1} 4\pi R_{1}^{2} }{ \sigma_{2} 4\pi R_{2}^{2} } &= \frac{ R_{1} }{ R_{2} } \\
\frac{ \sigma_{1} }{ \sigma_{2} } &= \frac{ R_{2} }{ R_{1} }
\end{split}
$$
Thus, areal *charge density is inversely proportional to radius.*

Heat dissipated from the conducting wire can be given as,
$$
\begin{split}
\text{Heat} &= U_{i} - U_{f} \\
&= \text{self energy}_{i} - \text{self energy}_{f} \\
&= \frac{ kQ_{1}^{2} }{ 2R_{1} } + \frac{ kQ_{2}^{2} }{ 2R_{2} } - \left( \frac{ kq_{1}^{2} }{ 2R_{1} } + \frac{ kq_{2}^{2} }{ 2R_{2} } \right) 
\end{split}
$$

##### Concentric Spheres Connected by Wire
Final charges on the shells,
$$
\begin{split}
V_{A} &= V_{B} \\
\frac{ kx^{2} }{ R_{1} } + \frac{ k(Q_{1}+Q_{2} - x)^{2} }{ R_{2} } &= \frac{ kx^{2} }{ R_{2} } + \frac{ k(Q_{1}+Q_{2} - x)^{2} }{ R_{2} } \\
\frac{ kx^{2} }{ R_{1} } &= \frac{ kx^{2} }{ R_{2} } \\
x &= 0
\end{split}
$$
This means that all the charge goes to the outer shell.

Example,
![](images/Pasted image 20231214201201.png)

### Grounding/Earthing 
Earth is considered a large conducting sphere. 

Earth's charge and potential is fixed and is thus considered zero. 

Any appliance connected with Earth has its potential dropped to zero.

If a conducting object is connected to earth through a conducting wire, then its electric potential will become the same as earth, i.e. zero.

### Charge dist. and Induction in Cavity 
There is a point charge q inside the cavity. 

We take a gaussian surface enclosing the cavity. 

Flux through this surface,
$$\phi = \oint \vec{E}.d\vec{s} = 0$$
Since there is no field inside conductor. 

Using gauss law,
$$\phi = \frac{ q + q_{ind} }{ \varepsilon_{o} } = 0$$
Thus giving,
$$q_{ind} = -q$$

### Electrostatic Shielding 
Distribution of induced charge in the cavity is decided by shaped of it and positions of the charges inside it.

Distribution of charge on outer surface depends on shape of it and the positions of other charges.

Charges inside cavity and charge induced on it will have no *net* electric effect outside the cavity. 

Charges outside outer surface and charge on it will have no *net* electric effect inside the cavity. 

This is known as Electrostatic Shielding,

### Large Conducting  Plate
Between non metallic and metallic plates, charge distribution is different. In metallic plate, the charge is distributed in two layers, and thus the charge density is half for metallic plate.

![](images/Pasted image 20231214213601.png)

However, if charge given is the same, then field is also the same.
And if $\sigma$ is the same, the charge and thus the field for the metallic plate will be double. 

Proof that the charge is distributed evenly,
![](images/Pasted image 20231214214909.png)

#### Field due to large conducting plate 
By gauss law. 

We make a cylindrical gaussian surface on one of the sides of the plate. One of the circles of the cylinder is inside the metal plate.  

The flux through this is,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} + \phi_{3} \\
&= EA + 0 + 0 
\end{split}
$$

Using gauss law,
$$
\begin{split}
\phi &= \frac{ \sigma A }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
EA &= \frac{ \sigma A }{ \varepsilon_{o} } \\
E &= \frac{ \sigma }{ \varepsilon_{o} }
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231214214707.png)

#### Induction of Charge 
If two large metallic plates are placed parallelly near each other, then charging on their opposing faces will be equal and opposite.

![](images/Pasted image 20231214215830.png)

To find the induced charge, we always do $E_{in} = 0$ for any point inside any of the conductors. 

Short cut if there is no external electric field,

##### Examples 
We are not writing the elrctric field due to Q-x and x-Q because they will cancel each other.

![](images/Pasted image 20231214221940.png)

#### Earthing of Plate 
Final charge on isolated metallic plate becomes zero. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231215172026.png)

However if there is some other charged plate near it, the charge on one side of the plate will increase while the other side will decrease. 

The left most and the right most charge will become zero.

\noindent {}
They are non-conductors and they have no free electrons.

They are divided into two parts,
#### Polar Molecules 
Where the +ve and -ve charge do not coincide. 
I.e. nucleus and COM of e doesn't coincide.

Centres of +ve charge and -ve charge do not coincide. 

Polar molecules have some dipole moment. 
$$P = qd$$

On applying electric field, dipole moment changes. In general dipole moment increases. 

First the dipole aligns and then the dipole moment increases. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231219122610.png)

#### Non Polar Molecules 
Centres of +ve charge and -ve charge coincide and thus the dipole moment is zero in absence of external electric field.

On applying external electric field, the molecules get polarized and a dipole moment is created along the field. 

On removing the external electric field, dipole moment becomes zero. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231219123059.png)

### Polarization 
The aligning of all the dipole moments along the electric field is called Polarization. 

The ease with which the dielectric aligns with the field is a property of the material. 

![](images/Pasted image 20231219123647.png)

After the application of external field, there will be a layer of +ve and a layer of -ve charges. 

These charges are bounded and has charge density $\sigma_{d}$. 

Due to these bounded charges, there will be an electric field, $E_{b}$. The intensity of this field is a property of the material.

Thus the net electric field inside will be,
$$E_{net} = E_{o} - E_{b}$$
This field is,
$$E_{net} = \frac{ E_{o} }{ \varepsilon_{r} }$$
$\varepsilon_{r}$ is dielectric constant and is property of the material. 

Material which are easily polarized have higher $\varepsilon_{r}$. 

The field due to bounded charge is,
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{ E_{o} }{ \varepsilon_{r} } &= E_{o} - E_{b} \\
E_{b} &= E_{o} \left( 1 - \frac{ 1 }{ \varepsilon_{r} } \right)
\end{split}
$$

![](images/Pasted image 20231219125224.png)

### Polarization Vector 
It is dipole moment per unit volume. 

It is always along dipole moment (from -ve to +ve charge).

Its unit is $\ce{ C m^{-2} }$. Which is the same as $\sigma$.
